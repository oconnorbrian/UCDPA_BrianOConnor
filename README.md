**Introduction**


In this project, I analyzed a dataset on Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) by major tech companies—including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and others—to understand how and where these companies have spent billions acquiring other businesses. The overall goal is to provide insights into how big tech firms grow through acquisitions and how their strategies have evolved over the years. This project was completed as part of my Grading Process to recieve my **Professional Certificate in Data Analytics for Business** from University College Dublin.

**Objectives:**
* Identify trends over time in tech acquisitions
* Analyze spending patterns across different companies
* Explore the types of businesses being acquired

**Data Analyst Skills Demonstrated:**
* Data Acquisition: Sourcing real-world data from Kaggle
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing formats
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing acquisition trends and spending
* Data Visualization: Creating plots to illustrate patterns over time
* Insight Generation: Drawing conclusions about the strategic behavior of tech companies
